 nobles_estate_events.1.t:0 "Noble Birth"
 nobles_estate_events.1.d:0 "Many of the families of the $ESTATE_NOBILITY$ won their current position due to the actions of a forefather who served the state in times of war. For most of their sons a life in the field is therefore the only imaginable career. With the modernization of the army, however, common officers are no longer entirely unusual. Members of the Nobility have now approached us asking that we guarantee what they feel is the given right of their class. No man should be able to take service as a commander in the [Root.GetAdjective] armies who is not of noble birth!"

Over the last few decades a charismatic champion of the $ESTATE_NOBILITY$ has successfully managed to increase the power of the leading families of the $ESTATE_NOBILITY$ over most of the institutions of our country.\nContacts and privileges can be powerful things, especially combined with ambition."

 nobles_estate_events.3.t:1 "Encroachment of the $ESTATE_NOBILITY$ in [noble_encroachment.GetName]"
 nobles_estate_events.3.d:1 "It's hard to monitor everyone everywhere all the time and the boundaries between individual land properties are often grounded in old traditions or documents written when the landscape may have looked quite different. For someone with the right resources this can be exploited. A number of prominent $ESTATE_NOBILITY$ families have used their considerable influence in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] to get away with expanding their properties in [noble_encroachment.GetName] considerably. If we want to protect the property of the state we must act soon."

As the ruler of [Root.GetName] [Root.Monarch.GetName] has a responsibility to protect his people, not doing so will make us appear weak and may harm the long-term growth of the province. The $ESTATE_NOBILITY$ would likely not take kindly to chastising such a powerful member of their ranks however."

In some cases the $ESTATE_MERCHANTS$ of our country are able to spend just as lavishly if not more so than the average noble. While there are old rules and traditions restricting such things for those of less noble birth these are hard to enforce efficiently. This is unacceptable to the powerful $ESTATE_NOBILITY$ of our country who are now demanding that we update our laws on what an outsider can and cannot wear. They now suggest a number of heavy fines for anyone trying to rise visibly above their betters."

Being able to attend the bedroom of the ruler as [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] dresses for instance is considered by many to be the best way to gain the ear of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. An elaborate court life will certainly limit the power of our nobles to plot against us in their countryside properties but it could also prove quite expensive. Denying them the right to be part of the daily life of our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] entirely on the other hand would also limit their influence but the $ESTATE_NOBILITY$ would likely resent it."
 nobles_estate_events.7.a:0 "Let's keep it at a modest level."

The great sense of distrust is plainly visible by the almost deserted court in [Root.Capital.GetCapitalName] as most prominent families keep to their countryside manors. Unless we do something soon state authority will deteriorate in the areas controlled by the $ESTATE_NOBILITY$ but any demands from the state will likely be met with arms in hand at this point."

Generations ago their families served us or the states before us and won their current status on the field of battle. Ever since then most of them have kept their old traditions alive, training for a life in the field and making connections with others of the same inclination.\nThe current state of affairs in our country, however, has left us with few members of the $ESTATE_NOBILITY$ willing to fight our battles. Insubordination has become widespread among the higher officers and we have good reason to suspect more than a few hope for an unsuccessful war."

 burghers_estate_events.5.d:0 "Grain prices are notoriously unstable, anything from the weather where it is grown to incidents hurting its distribution can suddenly cause the price to rise significantly. As a result of one such sudden change there is currently an acute shortage of grain in many of our larger cities. Desperate to feed themselves the common people are directing their anger at the merchants who they feel are making good use of this situation to overcharge for their wares. The merchants themselves on the other hand claim that this is a natural result of the shortage and that there simply isn't enough bread to go around."

 burghers_estate_events.6.d:1 "The $ESTATE_MERCHANTS$ are not the sole authority within their cities, the $ESTATE_PRIESTHOOD$ also have a strong presence in most big cities going back to their initial founding. Conflicts sometimes arise when the councils of the $ESTATE_MERCHANTS$ implement rules that the $ESTATE_PRIESTHOOD$ disapprove of.\nSuch conflicts have become more and more commonplace and members of the $ESTATE_PRIESTHOOD$ are openly acting in defiance of the various rules the $ESTATE_MERCHANTS$ have agreed upon in their cities. Delegates from various cities dominated by the $ESTATE_MERCHANTS$ are now urging us to clarify the situation."

 burghers_estate_events.7.d:0 "The $ESTATE_MERCHANTS$ feel that they are unduly taxed and regulated when taking in mind the great importance of their work for our country. Tolls, taxes and various tariffs are holding them back from being able to accomplish even greater things and they will not hesitate to use all of their influence to abolish them."

 burghers_estate_events.8.d:0 "The interests of prominent merchant households are being hurt by our repressive trade policies towards other countries. The $ESTATE_MERCHANTS$ support these families and have now petitioned us to compensate them by at least opening up some other restrictions on trade to compensate for their loss of income."
 burghers_estate_events.8.a:0 "We must support the $ESTATE_MERCHANTS$."
 burghers_estate_events.8.b:0 "We cannot let our trade policy be decided by these peddlers."
 burghers_estate_events.9.t:0 "Cottage Industry"
 burghers_estate_events.9.d:1 "Economic development is not always without conflict. It seems rich merchants in some of our $ESTATE_MERCHANTS$-dominated cities have been attempting to bypass various guild privileges by outsourcing work to the homes of families living outside the city. The fact that this 'Putting-out System' has been a very profitable strategy only further enflames the anger of the artisans in the city, who feel their ancient rights have been trampled and that the carefully managed prices of their products will suffer. The [Root.GetAdjective] artisans now turn to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] to defend their privileges as the city council has been unable to root out competition from outside the city."
 burghers_estate_events.9.a:0 "We cannot stand in the way of progress."
 burghers_estate_events.9.b:0 "We must safeguard the artisans privileges."
 burghers_estate_events.10.t:0 "Social Mobility"
 burghers_estate_events.10.d:0 "The growing power of the $ESTATE_MERCHANTS$ has led to individuals from within their ranks to seek their fortunes in areas traditionally dominated by other groups. The sons of mid to low prominence families of the $ESTATE_MERCHANTS$ now have the education and the ambition to match the more privileged classes and as a result an increasing number of them are now being employed as administrators, lawyers, officers as well as in other positions traditionally dominated by another estate. The $ESTATE_MERCHANTS$ still feel they are being unduly held back by the archaic rights and privileges of another era but their adversaries are growing very weary of the current 'unnatural' social mobility.\nUnless we do something we risk losing the support of the privileged classes but if we withdraw our support of the $ESTATE_MERCHANTS$ at this point this will likely have grave effects on our relations with them."
 burghers_estate_events.10.a:0 "We must not stand in the way of these new men."

 burghers_estate_events.12.t:0 "The risks of Trade"
 burghers_estate_events.12.d:0 "Trade over large distances can be risky, if profitable. The weather, brigands and pirates remain a threat on land as well as on water. Normally the $ESTATE_MERCHANTS$ can cope with a certain amount of mishaps and have their own ways to protect themselves and insure their cargo. Lately, however, things have been going badly for a large number of Merchant families and some are at risk of bankruptcy. It may be prudent to offer some financial compensation to get them back on their feet."

 burghers_estate_events.13.d:0 "While only a small portion of our population live in the cities the growing prosperity of the $ESTATE_MERCHANTS$ is attracting an increasing number of people from the countryside. Some cities are growing so quickly that existing problems in terms of sanitation and overcrowding have gone from troubling to catastrophic according to the $ESTATE_MERCHANTS$. The poor have taken up residence outside the city walls where filthy suburbs have sprung up and disease thrives.\nThe $ESTATE_MERCHANTS$ find the situation intolerable and are now requesting that the state step in to provide help both in terms of resources and enforcement of rules outside of the walls. Only this way can this increasing urbanization actually lead to something good."
 burghers_estate_events.13.a:0 "Attempt to improve conditions."

 burghers_estate_events.14.t:0 "Economic Policy"
 burghers_estate_events.14.d:0 "As the $ESTATE_MERCHANTS$ grow in power their calls for fewer trade regulations and taxes become more and more frequent. Many feel our country has an old-fashioned and repressive trade policy and that we would benefit from reducing the amount of taxes and tolls that hinder commerce."

 burghers_estate_events.15.d:0 "The continuously deteriorating relationship between the state and the $ESTATE_MERCHANTS$ has reached the point where there is little trust at all for the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] in our major cities. Every state initiative is suspected at being aimed to contain the power of the $ESTATE_MERCHANTS$ and tax evasion has become widespread.\nIt has now come to the point that a number of guilds have begun a general strike, demanding greater autonomy and freedom from the overbearing state."
 burghers_estate_events.15.a:0 "They must be joking!"
 burghers_estate_events.15.b:0 "Give in to their demands."

 #Clans

 tribal_estate_events.1.d:0 "The difference between tax collection, extortion or demanding tribute can sometimes be somewhat vague. In many parts of our country taxes are collected by the Clans in ways very similar to how they would have conducted themselves during a raid.\nToday an emissary from some of our more well-to-do subjects arrived to tell a tale of how the would-be tax collectors pillaged their lands and then laid siege to their fortified homes. They now demand retribution from the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and for the perpetrators to be punished. The clans would, however, likely not take kindly to any such restrictions of their conduct."

 tribal_estate_events.2.a:0 "Ok."
 tribal_estate_events.3.t:0 "Decline of Clan Influence"
 tribal_estate_events.3.d:0 "Due to infighting between clans, poorly thought out political maneuvers and conflicts relating to succession our influence over the other clans has increased considerably during the last few years.

 desc_nobility_sumptuary_restrictions:0 "We have implemented a series of harsh restrictions on who can and cannot buy certain luxury items.

Apart from cementing social boundaries this has resulted in a sharp decline in prices for most goods that have anything to do with the restrictions."

 desc_elaborate_court_ceremonies:0 "We have decided to turn the courtly life of our country into the most elaborate formality imaginable.
