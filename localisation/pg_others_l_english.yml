 PP_BASE_TAX_VALUE2:0 "Upper Class Population is $VAL|Y$, with each level giving:\n$EACH$\n\n§YUpper Class Population§! represents the aristocrats, the clergy and the wealthy citizens. \nUnder legacy system: it grows over time, and there is a small chance that §YCommoner Population§! gets promoted to the §YUpper Class§!. This chance is increased by:\n-§GProsperity§!\n-§GBuildings: Temple, Market, Government§!\nUnder §MPopgrowth§!: it will be roughly §G10%§! of the tribals and commoners, raised further with §Ghigh-end buildings§! (temples, academies, palaces) and others (being the country's §Gcapital§!, or §Gmonuments§!). Can't grow by itself, only promote into."
 PP_BASE_PROD_VALUE:0 "Commoner Population is $VAL|Y$, with each level giving:\n$EACH$\n\n§YCommoner Population§! represents merchants, craftsmen and other citizens living in urban environments. \nUnder legacy system: it grows over time, and there is a small chance that §YTribal Population§! gets promoted to the §YCommoner Population§!. This chance is increased by:§GProsperity§! and §GBuildings§!: Market, Production. It can also grow by itself, although very slowly, and is helped by §GBuildings§! (Roads and Baths). \nUnder §MPopgrowth§!: §YTribals§! promote to §YCommoners§! with good §Gproduction§!, §Gsurplus food§!, §GBuildings§! (almost all of them), §YTrade power§! also provides capacity.

Their lack of sophistication in economic matters (providing 0.1 of each tax, goods production and trade power) is offset by more able-bodied people for our manpower reserves. \nUnder legacy system: it grows over time, helped with §GTerrain type§! and §GProsperity§!. \nUnder §MPopgrowth§!: §Gprovince size§! provides 1 each size point; terrain type may affect both §Ggood§! or §Rbadly§!, although it can be improved with §Ghealth buildings§!. The more free space (difference between capacity and current population), the more growth and thus the faster it will increase. Growth ratio over 1.00 will allow it to grow, while uner 1.00 will make them §OMigrate§! or §RStarve§!."
