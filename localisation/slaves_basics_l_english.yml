 # Estate privileges (plenty)
 estate_slaves_status_1:0 "Status: War captives"
 estate_slaves_status_1_desc:0 "What is best in life? To crush your enemies, see them driven before you, and to hear the lamentations of their women. And once this is done, what shall be done of these new mouths to feed? Our country, probably under a tribal organization, has not made into written law what to do with captives. We will have to decide what to do with captives, either to accept them, sell, or else. \nTo 'advance' to newer systems, the country must stop being tribal, or having sufficient technology (ADM 10). \n§OGame effects§! - Taking slaves on sieges is §Yallowed§!. Buying is §Rforbidden§!, selling is §Yallowed§!. Slave liberation is unheard of, but possible. Allocation into manufactories is §Rnot allowed§!."
 estate_slaves_status_2:0 "Status: Serfdom"
 estate_slaves_status_2_desc:0 "In our tradition there has always been a role to the servant, the thrall, or the serf. While these peoples are bound to either their land, God or palace, this bond is respected and cannot be commanded to do other tasks. \nSerfdom enforces a traditional, albeit inefficient, type of slavery. The population subject to it won't be able to be assigned into manufactories (unless they are already there), nor benefit laws possible to be enacted. They are 'static' slaves and thus inefficient compared to other systems. \nTo 'advance' to newer systems, a sufficient technology is needed (ADM 15), or to become a non-tribal nation. \n§OGame effects§! - Taking slaves on sieges is §Yallowed§!. Buying is §Rforbidden§!, selling outside new captives is §Rforbidden§! under 100% population. Slave liberation is forbidden. Allocation into manufactories is §Rnot allowed§!."

At the same time, having clear laws on slaves, it also gives a clear way into purchasing one's freedom. \n§OGame effects§! - Taking slaves on sieges is §Yallowed§!. Buying is §Yallowed§!, selling is §Yallowed§!. Slave liberation is increased compared to other regimes. Benefit laws (after the first three privileges) are fully possible. "

Buying is §Yallowed§!, selling is §Yallowed§!. Slave liberation is greatly restricted. Benefit laws (after the first three privileges) are fully possible. \n This is one of the two options to §Yabolish slavery§!."
 estate_slaves_status_6:0 "Status: Criminal only"
 estate_slaves_status_6_desc:0 "The laws on our country only allow taking one person's liberty as a punishment. Therefore once the years are done, freedom is guaranteed. \n§OGame effects§! - Taking slaves on sieges is §Rforbidden§!. All slave trade is §Rforbidden§!. Slave liberation is greatly increased, hoping that one day no one must fall under it. You will run out of slaves eventually!
